=====
Adds simple crash management for Trac.

Note: TracCrashDump 0.3 requires Trac 0.12 or higher.

The following report can be used for crashes group by product and version:

SELECT p.value AS __color__,
c.productname || " " || c.productversion || " (" || c.producttargetversion || ")" AS __group__,
   c.uuid AS _crash,
   c.crashtime as crashtime,
   c.crashusername AS 'Crash user',
   c.crashhostname AS 'Crash hostname',
   c.status,
   c.priority,
   c.component,
   c.version,
   c.milestone,
   c.applicationname as Application,
   c.machinetype || "/" || c.systemname AS 'System name',
   c.osversion AS 'OS Version',
   c.buildtype AS 'Build Type',
   (SELECT group_concat(ticket) from crashdump_ticket where crash=c.id) AS linked_tickets
FROM crashdump c
LEFT JOIN enum p ON p.name = c.priority AND p.type = 'priority'
WHERE c.status <> 'closed'
ORDER BY CAST(p.value AS integer), c.crashtime
